# Debit Card Fraud Detection

This project was completed from December 2022 to February 2023 as a part of a machine learning course. The objective of this project was to develop a model to identify fraudulent debit card transactions.

## Project Details

* Developed a machine learning model using a hybrid of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify fraudulent transactions.
* Trained and tested the hybrid model on a dataset obtained from Kaggle, achieving an accuracy rate of 85.7%.

## Tools and Technologies

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* Numpy

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains information on debit card transactions. The dataset includes a range of features such as transaction amount, merchant category code, and transaction date and time.

## Future Work

In the future, the model could be further refined to improve its accuracy rate. Additionally, more data could be collected to train the model on a larger and more diverse dataset.
